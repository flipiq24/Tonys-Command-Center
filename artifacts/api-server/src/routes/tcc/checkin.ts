const TONY_PERSONAL_DOC = `
WHO I AM — CORE IDENTITY
I am a disciple of Jesus Christ first. My faith is the foundation of everything. My purpose is not success — it is obedience. Success follows obedience. Not the other way around.

I am a husband to Stephanie. I am a father to our children. I am a provider, protector, and leader of my household. Business is the vehicle, not the destination.

THE MISSION
Build a real estate investment company that generates freedom — financial, time, and impact — so I can lead my family, serve my community, and operate from a position of strength, not desperation.

The three non-negotiables every single day:
1. BIBLE — The anchor. Without this, everything else drifts. No compromise.
2. WORKOUT — The body is the machine. You don't maintain a machine, it breaks. Period.
3. JOURNAL — The mind must process. What isn't written is forgotten. What isn't examined is repeated.

These aren't optional. These are the system. If I skip these, I am not operating. I am drifting.

THE AWARENESS LOOP TRAP
Here is the lie I tell myself: "I'm preparing. I'm getting ready. I'm learning." But preparation without action is a disguise for avoidance. I have studied enough. I know enough. The only thing left is execution.

The awareness loop is when I gain insight, feel the weight of it, and then do nothing. I am aware. I am convicted. And then I go back to the same patterns. That is not growth. That is entertainment. This stops now.

EGO OVER OBEDIENCE
The second trap: pride. I want to look productive. I want to feel in control. But control is an illusion, and productivity without obedience is vanity.

Obedience to God. Obedience to the plan. Obedience to the standard I've set for myself. Not performance. Not image. Obedience.

WHAT GOES ON TOP
The morning rituals — Bible, workout, journal — go on top. Not after email. Not after calls. Not after I feel ready. Before anything. These are the non-negotiables that protect everything else.

If I compromise the top, everything underneath degrades. The deals suffer. The relationships suffer. My mind suffers. There is no "I'll do it later today." Later is a lie I tell myself when I want to skip.

THE COMMITMENTS
- I will not touch my phone for business before completing the morning three.
- I will protect my mornings like they are the most important asset I have — because they are.
- I will execute, not plan. Ship, not prepare.
- I will lead from strength, not panic.
- I will trust the system, not my feelings.
- Obedience comes before comfort. Every. Single. Time.

THE STANDARD
This is the bar. Not what I hope to do someday. What I do every day. No exceptions. No renegotiation. No "just this once."

If I'm not living this, I'm not leading. If I'm not leading myself, I cannot lead my family, my team, or my clients. Everything flows from this.

- Close with one of his specific commitments from the document.
- Keep it under 150 words. No fluff. No generic motivation. His words, his standard, his choice.
